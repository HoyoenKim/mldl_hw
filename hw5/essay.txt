### Essay: Kaggle Re-Submit trend prediction methodology based on EDA analysis of User Profile and survival regression of Submission Record

### 1. Introduction

  A diverse of students participated in the Kaggle competition. The purpose of the essay is to construct a predictive model that forecasts the likelihood and timing of resubmissions by analyzing student profiles and submission records. First of all, develop several hypotheses about students' resubmission tendencies according to the meaning of the columns in the UserProfile table. Also present a method to verify this using an exploratory data analysis methodology. Second, analyze students' resubmission tendencies through survival analysis along with psychological factors in the SubmissionRecord table. Third, present a model by integrating the students' tendencies presented in the first main body and the submission survival analysis conclusions presented in the second main body. Finally, discuss how to evaluate the model using metrics such as the model's c-index. In conclusion, student trends and submission log trends must be comprehensively analyzed to effectively predict trends in the re-appearance of students participating in Kaggle competitions.

### 2.1. EDA analysis of User Profile

  UserProfile Table includes academic status, field of study, GPA, IQ, study hours, and MBTI personality type. First, the GPA is an indicator of academic performance. A higher GPA student might fewer but more accurate submissions since they spend more time refining their solutions. Second, IQ is an indicator of a participantâ€™s problem-solving speed and intellectual capacity. A higher IQ student might higher both the quality of submission and the speed after initial submission. Third, Study hour is an indicator of insight into the time a student dedicates to their course. Study hours could be inversely related or related to submission frequency. If students who study more may feel more prepared and thus submit less frequently, then it is inversely related. If they may be more engaged to optimize their solutions and thus submit more frequently, then it is related. Fourth, MBTI personality types are an indicator of behavioral tendencies. For example, participants with an INTJ personality might be more strategic. Thus they tend to submit less if there is no improvement. Whereas an ENTP might be more experimental. Thus they tend to higher number of submissions.

  To conduct the EDA, employ various statistical techniques. First, compute the mean, median, and standard deviation for GPA, IQ, and study hours. Second, uses correlation coefficients to find the relationships between quantitative factors (GPA and IQ) with the frequency and quality of submissions. Third, uses chi-square tests to find the association between MBTI types and submission behaviors. Also, figure the histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots of GPA, IQ, and study hours. Use these pictures to determine the relationship between variables and submission accuracy. Lastly, perform cluster analysis to identify distinct groups of students with similar profiles and submission patterns. A tree model and KNN could be used.

### 2.2. Survival Regression of Submission Record

  SubmissionRecord Table includes timestamps, accuracy scores, and whether the target accuracy was achieved. First, pre-process the timestamps into a suitable format for survival analysis. Which is the time since the last submission. Second, define the event. The event of interest is the resubmission of a solution. Then censor data accordingly. Submissions that do not occur in the observation period are censored. Third, create time-dependent covariates that may affect the hazard rate. For example, change in accuracy score between consecutive submissions and the elapsed time since achieving target accuracy. Lastly, Use the Cox model to identify factors that significantly influence the likelihood and timing of resubmissions.

  To examine the model, use hazard ratios and survival curves. First, Interpret the hazard ratios to find the effect of each variable on the likelihood of a resubmission. Second, plot survival curves for different strata to visualize the estimated survival function from the Cox model. For example, stratificated with achieving target accuracy.

### 2.3. Integration of EDA analysis and Survival Regression

  Model integration involves four steps. First, combine the insights of the User Profile EDA analysis result. Second feature engineering. Determine the whether feature affects dynamic submission patterns. Third model selection. Select the model made by the first and second steps under considering the Cox proportional hazards model. Lastly, assume that the model follows Hawkes's process. That means the model that assumes past submissions affects the likelihood of future submissions.

  Model evaluation involves three steps. First, use the Concordance Index. A higher c-index indicates a better model fit. Second, use the bootstrapping. That ensures the robustness of the model and makes confidence intervals for the survival functions. Third, compare analysis. Compare three models one is only baseline, the second is baseline with Cox Model other is baseline with Cox Model and Hawkes Process.
